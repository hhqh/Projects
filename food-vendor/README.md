### Food Vendor Project

This program allows existing variant customers to purchase food/meal from a vendor. Each customer class is design to adhere to different types of customer 
needs (e.g. customer who is allergic to a certain ingredient cannot purchase the meal). Each meal/entree has nutrition facts, expired date, spoiled date, 
and ingredients. Each vendor has more than one meal/entree that checks if entree is in stock.
